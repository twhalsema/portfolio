# Thomas Halsema - Professional Portfolio
## Welcome
Thank you for visiting my professional portfolio. I have prepared this repository as a way to showcase my skillset.
This portfolio is a work in progress, and I intend to include additional automations and enhancements to it in the coming weeks.

At the time of writing (July 2024), I am currently looking for a new job. I have been an Oracle DBA for over 12 years, and I am ready to try something new. Over the last several months, I have been learning skills aligned with the following positions:

- Site Reliability Engineer
- DevOps Engineer
- Infrastructure Engineer

I encourage anyone considering me for employment to look over this portfolio to make a more informed hiring decision.

## What is in this portfolio?
This portfolio consists of 3 parts:
1. <b>Walman</b> (short for Wallet Manager) - A python program which allows the user to declaratively build Oracle wallets (database credential stores) and deploy them to remove database client servers.
2. Ansible and other automation files to create a test environment to demo <b>Walman</b>.
3. Documentation for <b>Walman</b>. This is both to allow anyone viewing my portfolio to better understand it as well as to highlight my technical writing ability.
